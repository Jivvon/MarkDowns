### summary

Netflix has more than doubled the number of new subscribers it thought it would get this year. The doubling of subscriptions is due to the coronavirus pandemic. A Netfilx official said the surge in membership numbers was probably temporary. The rate of new memberships would probably go down and return to normal after lockdowns end. The company said "We are aware that we are fortunate to have a service that is even more meaningful to people confined at home. We hope that home confinement ends soon."
