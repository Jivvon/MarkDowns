### summary

The whole of Italy is under lockdown. It is one of the countries worst affected by the COVID-19. The whole country is under lockdown but not everyone is following the rules. Some mayors in Italy are posting angry messages on social media. The mayor of one town said to who walking their dogs many times a day that "... You need to stay home. People are dying... You are irresponsible idiots...". Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said that Everyone's efforts are needed to protect social and economic fabric of our country.



#### Do you strongly believe the whole world should be locked down for two weeks? Or do you strongly believe the opposite? Write down a couple of sentences to support your idea.

I think it should be opened properly. Strong lock down should bring about economic down, but free open might bring awful situation around the world. So, it should be compromised and opened properly the whole world.
