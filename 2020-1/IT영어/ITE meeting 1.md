I have about more than 6 hours of free time for a day. It's except that I have to do something like class or assignment.

not very important to me. I can do anything even it's study or assignment.

##### **If you had more free time, what would you do?**

maybe, I would sleep more time and study my research area.
It's the block chain. I'm in Cyber Security Laboratory from this month. I don't know what I have to do and what I can do. So I will study for my role.


##### **“Time is money.” Do you agree or disagree? Why?**

I agree. because whatever I do, I need time.

I like to develop automation programs like macros because I think time is really important.
