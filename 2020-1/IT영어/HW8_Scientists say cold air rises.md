### summary

Researchers in the University of California discovered that in tropical atmospheres, cold air rises because of the lightness of water vapour. Lead researcher Dr Da Yang said: "Water vapour has a buoyancy effect which helps release the heat of the atmosphere to space and reduce the degree of warming. Without this lightness of water vapour, the climate warming would be even worse." Another researcher, Seth Seidel, said more research is needed to find out the effects rising cool air has on climate change, and on its impact on curbing the effects of global warming. The study is published in the journal "Science Advances".
