### summary

Scientists developed the algorithms a form of artificial intelligence that can decode brainwaves and translate them into text from University of California, Sanfrancisco. Their algorithms have a 97 percent translation accuracy rate, but They are working hard to improve on this. The software used in their experiments matched features of speech that were repeated frequently to parts and shapes of the mouth. The experiments were limited to around 40 short sentences. The scientists with regard to this said, it remains to show how many data would be required to expand from our tiny languages to a more general form of English.
