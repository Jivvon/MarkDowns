#### 자기소개

Hello I'm Jiwon Jeong, 

I'm major in Computer Science Engineering. 

I am always eager to learn about anything in this field. and I enjoy it.

To use what I have learned, I made a simple service using Python which can announce to client automatically and deployed it on Aws. This experience has provided a better understanding of servers and clients.

This experience will definitely help me and Disney grow.

Thank you.



You'll find out if you adopt me.

#### 왜 컴퓨터공학과에 진학했나

back in the middle school, I needed item which of level is legend on game. but, I didn't have time enough to get it. So, I bought a macro on the internet and then I used it. but, It looked like not too difficult for me. So I did make up my mind that I would make a macro. this mind made me it here.

- 무슨 매크로였니
  - it played the game and pick the item up  automatically. So, Whenever I arrived at home, I checked my inventory first.
- 지금 매크로 만든 거 있니
  - I made some macros from last year, one of them is supposed to register for class automatically. If vacancy comes out, it can take it first.

#### 강점

I enjoy studying and using new things. I think it's a big strength in a fast changing field.

-  최근에 공부해서 사용한 것이 있나요?
  - of course, I am studying about RDBMS. and I did exam to take the certification.
  - It was SQL Developer certification.
  - The result is not yet. I'll assume that it turns out July 8 or 7.
  - 합격할 것 같아? yes, if there's no happen.



#### 장단점

I'm a positive person. It's too obvious, sometimes around 'it seems too carefree.

They say, 'Oh, my God, you're so comfortable.' 

Whenever that happens, I think that no matter how hard it is, it will end someday, 

so I encourage people around me.

 As a result, there are always many people around me. 

But these positives also make me lazy, so I'm overcoming them by setting specific goals and dividing plans.

#### 뭐할거라예상해

I think enough that I can express my opinion at a meeting in addition, I will feel the atmosphere of the company and learn how the service works.

#### 자바스크립트로 뭐해봤어

#### 지난 한학기 IT영어 수업 어땠냐

It was cool. It affected me a lot. I can't understand what you want to say when I started it, but now, I can hear and understand more than a half of your talk. but it still not to easy to talk about what I want to say.

#### 왜 지원했냐

The main task was to set up the Samsung Notebook and record and report any errors in the internal network. Because of this, most of the time during that days, I think I worked like a Samsung service center.

#### 올림픽 패럴림픽에서 가장 기억에 남는 건?

The most memorable thing is that I was able to experience the culture of the Olympics. There is a pin trading culture in the Olympics, literally collecting pins related to the Olympics. 

If you go to an Olympic Park or something, you can see a pin trader anywhere on the street, and if you see what you want, you can ask for trade, and the other person can choose from the pins I have. 

**There's no exact trading standard rule and it's just a collection of pins, but a keyword to communicate freely with people from all over the world? The fact that there was the same thing made me feel excited and happy throughout the Olympics.**

#### 자료구조 튜터인데, 자료구조 하나만 얘기해줘

I want to tell you about Stack. A stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle. push** the item into the stack, and **pop** the item out of the stack. A stack is a limited access data structure - elements can be added and removed from the stack only at the top.

#### 뿌요뿌요

it is the game play the PUYOPUYO on the console. 

PUYOPUYO is a kind of tetris.

Playing Puyo Puyo is simple. All you have to do is **connect four or more Puyo of the same color** and they’ll pop! 

**When the third column from the left is filled up, the player will lose**. So the objective of the game is to make chains that will fill up your opponent’s board with garbage.
