The boss of Twitter has told many of his employees that they can work from home forever if they want to. They said it was in a good position to have many of its workers working from their home. It added, "We were uniquely positioned to respond quickly and allow folks to work from home", and "The past few months have proven we can make [working from home] work. If our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen."
