Hello my name is Jiwon Jeong



Recently, I'm starting to get interested in 파이썬. so I uploaded some programs on my github. one of the those is 'cnu-noti'. 

it's crawling our computer page's notices. and When a new notice is posted, it will be notified.



Im major in computer engineering. I think people in this field should good at english well.

but even I am not good at, I haven't studied English since high school

so I plan to study through reference in Ppt.



I'm afraid I can't do "MI333."
