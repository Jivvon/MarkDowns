### [ITEHW] Dear Minsun Lee.



Dear professor Minsun Lee. 

I am a student in your class 'IT English 1' at 2 P.M and glad to take your class. To be honest, 



I was afraid to take this class. because I'm not good at English and I think people in this field should good at english well. even I haven't studied it since high school. However, I am trying, and now I am writing this with a translator. So, I hope you to wait for me even I am poor in English.

Thanks for your time.

Regards,
Jiwon Jeong.
